# Upgrade openmetadata to latest version

You can get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/releases)

## Stop current service and backup the data

All OM metadata is stored inside a database(e.g. mysql or postgres). And they follow a certain version of a data model
which depends on the OM server version.
The data model(table names, schemas,...) is managed using [Flyway migrations](https://flywaydb.org/).
The structure of this data model can change. This means that the shape of the database is tightly coupled to your OpenMetadata Server version.

If a database migration is needed to upgrade the `OpenMetadata app`, you should find the migration scripts which handles
the migration [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/tree/main/bootstrap/sql).

Before you stop the current service, do a backup of the current database. For production environment, you can follow the
[Backup_and_restore.md](./02.Backup_and_restore.md). For dev environment you can just create a new database `backup` in
the current database container. If the migration failed and the database is currupted, you can role back with the old
docker compose file and the `backup` db.

```shell
export OM_DATABASE=backup
docker compose -f $OLD_DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE up -d
```

## Clean the existing deployment

```shell
# --rmi all Remove all images
# -v Remove the named volumes declared in the volumes section of docker-compose.yml and the anonymous volumes attached to the container
# --remove-orphans Remove containers not defined in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down --rmi all -v --remove-orphans
```
