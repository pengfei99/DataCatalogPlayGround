# Install openmeta data on bare metal

This tutorial is tested on `debian 11`.

## Step1: Install java (version 17 or higher)

OpenMetadata is built using `Java, DropWizard, and Jetty`.

Type the following command to verify that you have a supported version of the Java runtime installed.

```shell
java --version

# if you don't have java 17 or higher, run the following steps
sudo apt-cache search openjdk | grep 17

# if you have openjdk 17 on the output list, you can run the below command
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

## Step2: Install mysql (8.0 or higher)

The official installation doc is [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/linux-installation.html)

```shell
# get the deb file
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.30-1_all.deb

# install it via dpkg
sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.30-1_all.deb

# this deb file will change your source list, to debian will no longer install mariadb if you type `sudo apt install mysql-server`

# If you see an error `Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory`
# run the below command, then rerun the dpkg -i command
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"

# update your apt repo
sudo apt-get update

# install the mysql server
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

# a prompt will ask you to enter the root password, enter the casd2024

# check the installed server version
apt policy mysql-server
mysql-server:
  Installed: 8.4.0-1debian11
  Candidate: 8.4.0-1debian11
  Version table:
 *** 8.4.0-1debian11 500
        500 http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian bullseye/mysql-8.4-lts amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

# check the status
sudo systemctl status mysql

# connect to mysql server 
mysql -u root -p

# test the version
Select VERSION();

# create DB,
CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;

# create User 
create user 'user_name'@'localhost' indentified by "user_password";

# grant user access to the db
grant all privileges on <db_name>.* TO 'user_name'@'localhost';

# update the acl
Flush privileges;

# exit the server
QUIT
```

### Allow remote access
By default, the mysql server only binds on localhost, if you want to all remote access, you need to edit
`/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`

Add the following line or change it if exits:
```shell
bind-address = 0.0.0.0

# change user account name from localhost to wildcard
RENAME USER 'user_name'@'localhost' TO 'user_name'@'%';

# grant privilege to new user account with wildcard
grant all privileges on <db_name>.* TO 'user_name'@'%';

# update the acl
Flush privileges;

# exit the server
QUIT
```

> You also need to change the acl in mysql, localhost can be replaced by a remote ip address or `%` (wildcard for any ip)
## Step3: Install the elasticsearch (version 8.x)

The official elastic install doc is [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)

At the time, the latest stable version is `8.14`. So the below instruction works for installing `es 8.14` in debian 11.

```shell
# import the PGP key
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg

# Add the el repo to source.list.d
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list

# update repo and install elasticsearch
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

# after the above command, you will see many outputs, the generated password for the root user `elastic` is in it too.
# if you want to change it, you can run the below command
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic

# this will generate a new password
# we recommend you to add this password to your session with the below command
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your_password" 

# start the elastic search service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service

# enable the service at boot
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

# you can check the service status
sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service

# check the journal
sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch --since  "2024-06-10 18:17:16"
```

> we do not use the `add-apt-repository`, because it edits the original system `sources.list`. We prefer to create a new file
> `add-apt-repository` is not part of the default install for many linux distribution.

### 3.1 Test the elastic service

To test the elastic service, export the user password of elastic, then run the below command
You may need the sudo right to access the certificate `/etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt`.

```shell
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your_password" 
sudo curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD https://localhost:9200 

# You should see the below ouput
{
  "name" : "openmetada.casd.local",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "Y-kmMIp6SZ6KEl9zfzXdVg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.14.0",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "8d96bbe3bf5fed931f3119733895458eab75dca9",
    "build_date" : "2024-06-03T10:05:49.073003402Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.10.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

```

### 3.2 Configuring Elasticsearch

The **/etc/elasticsearch** directory contains the default runtime configuration for Elasticsearch. The ownership of 
this directory and all contained files are set to `root:elasticsearch` on package installations.

The `setgid` flag applies group permissions on the `/etc/elasticsearch` directory to ensure that Elasticsearch can 
read any contained files and subdirectories. All files and subdirectories inherit the `root:elasticsearch` ownership. 
Running commands from this directory or any subdirectories, such as the `elasticsearch-keystore` tool, requires 
`root:elasticsearch` permissions.

Elasticsearch loads its configuration from the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file by default. The format of 
this config file is explained in [Configuring Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html).

The Debian package also has a system configuration file (`/etc/default/elasticsearch`), which allows you to set the following parameters:

- **ES_JAVA_HOME**: Set a custom Java path to be used.
- **ES_PATH_CONF**: Configuration file directory (which needs to include elasticsearch.yml, jvm.options, and log4j2.properties files); 
                 defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`.
- **ES_JAVA_OPTS**: Any additional JVM system properties you may want to apply.
- **RESTART_ON_UPGRADE**: Configure restart on package upgrade, defaults to `false`. This means you will have to restart 
                       your Elasticsearch instance after installing a package manually. The reason for this is to 
                       ensure, that upgrades in a cluster do not result in a continuous shard reallocation resulting
                      in high network traffic and reducing the response times of your cluster.


### 3.4 Trouble shoot duplicate entries for el repo

If you have the following error: `Duplicate sources.list entry https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt/ ...`. You
need to examine `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch-8.x.list` for the duplicate entry or locate the duplicate 
entry amongst the files in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` and the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

### 3.5 Work with el default security

When installing Elasticsearch, security features are enabled and configured by default. When you install Elasticsearch, 
the following security configuration occurs automatically:

- Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for the elastic built-in superuser.
- Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer, and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.

You can find three import files in `/etc/elasticsearch/certs`
- **http_ca.crt**: The CA certificate that is used to sign the certificates for the HTTP layer of this Elasticsearch cluster.
- **http.p12**: Keystore that contains the key and certificate for the HTTP layer for this node.
- **transport.p12**: Keystore that contains the key and certificate for the transport layer for all the nodes in your cluster.

> The keystore is password protected, you can use the below command to get the password
> 
```shell

# Use the following command to retrieve the password for http.p12:
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-keystore show xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.secure_password

# Use the following command to retrieve the password for transport.p12
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-keystore show xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.secure_password
```
### 3.6 Disable ssl/tls

For test, you may need to disable the ssl/tls. 

In **/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml**, you can find all config of the elasticsearch

```shell
# Find the following lines related to SSL/TLS configuration:
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true

# Change the values from `true` to `false`:
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: false
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: false

# Then restart the service
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch

# test it with http
curl -u elastic:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD http://localhost:9200
```
